-- You can use current date for the rental_date column in the rental table.
-- Hint: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there.
-- You can query those pieces of information. For eg., you would notice that you need customer_id information as well.
-- To get that you can use the following query:

-- select customer_id from sakila.customer
-- where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';
-- Use similar method to get inventory_id, film_id, and staff_id.
